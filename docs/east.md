# ICBO-EAST 2025

ICBO-EAST 2025 will be held as a satellite meeting of the <b><a href="https://icbo-conference.github.io/icbo2025/">16th International Conference on Biological and Biomedical Ontology</a> (ICBO 2025</b>) in the East Asian time zone. This event is organized in collaboration with the <b>Special Interest Group of Semantic Web Ontology (SIGSWO)</b> of the <b><a href="https://www.ai-gakkai.or.jp/en/">Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence</a> (JSAI)</b> and <b>OntoChina</b>, in conjunction with the main ICBO organizing committee.

ICBO-EAST 2025 will be hosted in person in Nara, Japan, at the same venue as <b><a href="https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/">The 24th-International Semantic Web Conference</a> (ISWC 2025)</b>, allowing participants to benefit from both communities.

The meeting will feature a two-part one day schedule designed to enhance accessibility and regional engagement:
<ul>
  <li>Morning sessions (in English) will align with the main ICBO conference's Themes, featuring keynote talks, invited presentations, and selected paper sessions open to a global audience.</li>
  <li>Afternoon parallel sessions (in multiple languages) will provide regionally focused programming and discussions in local languages (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, and Thai), encouraging broader participation from East Asian communities.</li>
</ul>

ICBO-EAST aims to foster deeper collaboration across global and local biomedical ontology communities by bridging time zones, languages, and scientific perspectives.

### Keynote Speakers
<b>Dr. Achille Zappa and Dr. Yukie Akune-Taylor</b>
<ul>
  <li>Title: Glycoscience data and ontologies for understanding the expanded central dogma</li>
  <li>Bio: Dr. Achille Zappa and Dr. Yukie Akune-Taylor are conducting research at Glycan and Life Systems Integration Center (GaLSIC) at Soka University with Professor Kiyoko Aoki-Kinoshita. Their work focuses on exploring the complex functions of glycans using computational analysis and data mining techniques. This includes the development of glycan semantic knowledgebases, linked-data schemas and ontologies, as well as the analysis of glycanâ€“protein-lipid interactions.</li>
</ul>

<b>Dr. Tatsuya Kushida</b>
<ul>
  <li>Title: Utilizing Large Language Models to Build Causal Diagrams for Observational Health Research</li>
  <li>Abstract: Determination of causality is a fundamental objective in observational health research. Causal diagrams, also known as causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), are increasingly utilized to depict assumed causal relations among exposures, outcomes, and secondary variables such as confounders, colliders, and mediators of the effects of interest. However, constructing DAGs typically relies on human-readable literature or significance tests for variable correlations, which is impractical with the growth of scientific literature and complexity of variable interactions. DAGs typically involve three fundamental types: common causes (confounders), common effects (colliders), and intermediates between the investigated exposure-outcome variables. Manually building such a graph with distinct structural information is time-consuming, error-prone, and unsystematic for health researchers. This lecture introduces a knowledge-driven approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge graph to automate the construction of DAGs. It is expected to reduce information burden for health researchers in variables selection during causal modeling using observational health data.</li>
  <li>Bio: Jian Du obtained his PhD degree from School of Information Management, Nanjing University. He is am now an assistant professor at the National Institute of Health Data Science, Peking University. He has a mixed background of Biomedical Informatics and Library & Information Science. Before joining Peking University, he served as a research scientist at Institute of Medical Information, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Since 2020, he has led the Computable Biomedical Knowledge Group (cbk.bjmu.edu.cn), which focuses on natural language processing, literature mining and knowledge graph construction, and their applications in clinical epidemiology for major chronic diseases. His group is currently funded by the National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Dr. Du also contributes to the academic community as an editorial board member for Scientific Data, Health Data Science and BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making.</li>

  <li>Bio: Junguk Hur, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Director of the Computational Data Analysis Core at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences. His research integrates bioinformatics, systems biology, and literature mining to analyze and interpret multi-omics and biomedical big data, with applications in metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration, and host-pathogen interactions. Dr. Hur also leads ontology-driven research to improve data integration and knowledge discovery across diverse biomedical domains.</li>
